Looking beyond this field, isolated atomic planes can also be reassembled into designer heterostructures made layer by layer in a precisely chosen sequence.

abstract = {Graphene is a wonder material with many superlatives to its name. It is the thinnest material in the universe and the strongest ever measured. Its charge carriers exhibit giant intrinsic mobility, have the smallest effective mass (it is zero) and can travel micrometer-long distances without scattering at room temperature. Graphene can sustain current densities 6 orders higher than copper, shows record thermal conductivity and stiffness, is impermeable to gases and reconciles such conflicting qualities as brittleness and ductility. Electron transport in graphene is described by a Dirac-like equation, which allows the investigation of relativistic quantum phenomena in a bench-top experiment. What are other surprises that graphene keeps in store for us? This review analyses recent trends in graphene research and applications, and attempts to identify future directions in which the field is likely to develop. Graphene research has developed a truly relentless pace. Several papers appear every day and, if the bibliometrics predictions (1) are to be trusted, the amount of literature on graphene will keep rapidly increasing over the next few years. This makes it a real struggle to keep up with the developments. Newcomers are left without a broad perspective and are largely unaware of previous arguments and solved problems, whereas the community's doyens already show signs of forgetting their earlier papers. To combat this curse of success, many reviews have appeared in the last two years, and books on graphene are in the making. Among those, let me recommend our review (2) that provides a good introductory material and is far from being obsolete. The electronic properties of graphene were recently discussed in an extensive theory review (3), and this basic information is unlikely to require any revision soon. Also, I recommend more specialized papers discussing the quantum Hall effect in graphene, its Raman properties, epitaxial growth on SiC, etc. which are collected in (4). Despite or, perhaps, because of the vast amount of available literature, graphene research has now reached the stage where a strategic update is needed to cover the latest progress, emerging trends and opening opportunities. This paper is intended to serve this purpose without repeating, whenever possible, the information available in the earlier reviews. Growing Opportunities Graphene is a single atomic plane of graphite, which-and this is essential-is sufficiently isolated from its environment to be considered free-standing. Atomic planes are of course familiar to everyone as constituents of bulk crystals but one-atom-thick materials such as graphene remained unknown. The basic reason for this is that nature strictly forbids the growth of low-dimensional (D) crystals (2). Crystal growth implies high temperatures (T) and, therefore, thermal fluctuations that are detrimental for the stability of macroscopic 1D and 2D objects. One can grow flat molecules and nm-sized crystallites, but as their lateral size increases, the phonon density integrated over the 3D space available for thermal vibrations rapidly grows, diverging on a macroscopic scale. This forces 2D crystallites to morph into a variety of stable 3D structures. The impossibility to grow 2D crystals does not actually mean that they cannot be made artificially. With hindsight, this seems trivial. Indeed, one can grow a monolayer inside or on top of another crystal (as an inherent part of a 3D system) and then remove the bulk at sufficiently low T such that thermal fluctuations are unable to break atomic bonds even in macroscopic 2D crystals and mold them into 3D shapes. This consideration allows two principal routes for making 2D crystals (Fig. 1). One is to mechanically split strongly-layered materials such as graphite into individual atomic planes (Fig. 1A). This is how graphene was first isolated and studied. Although delicate and time consuming, the handcraft (often referred to as a scotch tape technique) provides crystals of high structural and electronic quality, which can currently reach sizes of a couple of mm. It is likely to remain the technique of choice for basic research and making proof-of-concept devices in the foreseeable future. Instead of cleaving graphite manually, it is also possible to automate the process by employing, for example, ultrasonic cleavage (5). This leads to stable suspensions of submicron graphene crystallites (Fig. 1B), which can then be used to make polycrystalline films and composite materials (5,6). Conceptually similar is the ultrasonic cleavage of chemically "loosened" graphite, in which atomic planes are partially detached first by intercalation, making the sonification more efficient (6). The sonification allows graphene production on industrial scale. The alternative route is to start with graphitic layers grown epitaxially on top of other crystals (7) (Fig. 1C). This is the 3D growth during which epitaxial layers remain bound to the underlying substrate and the bond-breaking fluctuations suppressed. After the epitaxial structure is cooled down, one can remove the substrate by chemical etching. Technically, this is similar to making, for example, SiN membranes but one-atom-thick crystals were deemed impossible to survive, and no one tried this route until recently (8-10). The isolation of epitaxial monolayers and their},

Those of various cases of short- and long-ranged scatterers have been obtained. To see the dependence on the range explicitly, numerical calculation has been performed for the system with scatterers with the Gaussian potential. Especially in case of short-ranged ones the peak value of the transverse conductivity has been shown to be (N+1⁄2)e2⁄$\pi$2h which depends only on the natural constants and the Landau level index. It has been argued from general point of view that this fact is approximately true without reference to kinds of approximations. Such characteristic of the conductivity was confirmed experimentally, but there still remain some problems as to the absolute value of the level width. {\textcopyright} 1974, THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

All these graphene-based nanostructures are expected to display the extraordinary electronic, thermal and mechanical properties of graphene and are thus promising candidates for a wide range of nanoscience and nanotechnology applications. In this paper, the electronic and quantum transport properties of these carbon nanomaterials are reviewed. Although these systems share the similar graphene electronic structure, confinement effects are playing a crucial role. Indeed, the lateral confinement of charge carriers could create an energy gap near the charge neutrality point, depending on the width of the ribbon, the nanotube diameter, the stacking of the carbon layers regarding the different crystallographic orientations involved. After reviewing the transport properties of defect-free systems, doping and topological defects (including edge disorder) are also proposed as tools to taylor the quantum conductance in these materials. Their unusual electronic and transport properties promote these carbon nanomaterials as promising candidates for new building blocks in a future carbon-based nanoelectronics, thus opening alternatives to present silicon-based electronics devices. {\textcopyright} 2009 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In contrast, encapsulation with atomically flat layered oxides such as mica, bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide, and vanadium pentoxide results in exceptionally low quality of graphene devices with mobilities of ∼1000 cm2 V-1 s-1. We attribute the difference mainly to self-cleansing that takes place at interfaces between graphene, hBN, and transition metal dichalcogenides.

In graphene placed on boron nitride and subjected to a magnetic field, self-similarity appears in the form of numerous replicas of the original Dirac spectrum, and their quantization gives rise to a fractal pattern of Landau levels, referred to as the Hofstadter butterfly. Here we employ capacitance spectroscopy to probe directly the density of states (DoS) and energy gaps in this spectrum. Without a magnetic field, replica spectra are seen as pronounced DoS minima surrounded by van Hove singularities. The Hofstadter butterfly shows up as recurring Landau fan diagrams in high fields. Electron-electron interactions add another twist to the self-similar behaviour. We observe suppression of quantum Hall ferromagnetism, a reverse Stoner transition at commensurable fluxes and additional ferromagnetism within replica spectra.

The dominant period of the oscillations shown in this paper corresponds to the area of the first Brillouin zone and its phase is zero. The origin of these quantum oscillations is the characteristic magnetic field dependence of the energy known as the Hofstadter butterfly and the Harper broadening of Landau levels. These oscillations are not caused by the crossing of the chemical potential and Landau levels, which is the case in dHvA oscillations.

Here we describe graphene junctions with a mean free path of several micrometres, low contact resistance and large supercurrents. Such devices exhibit pronounced Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot oscillations not only in the normal-state resistance but also in the critical current. The proximity effect is mostly suppressed in magnetic fields below 10 mT, showing the conventional Fraunhofer pattern. Unexpectedly, some proximity survives even in fields higher than 1 T. Superconducting states randomly appear and disappear as a function of field and carrier concentration, and each of them exhibits a supercurrent carrying capacity close to the universal quantum limit. We attribute the high-field Josephson effect to mesoscopic Andreev states that persist near graphene edges. Our work reveals new proximity regimes that can be controlled by quantum confinement and cyclotron motion.},

@article{Fujita2014,
abstract = {Magnetic oscillations in graphene under gate and bias voltages, measured by Tan et al. [Phys. Rev. B84, 115429 (2011)] are analyzed theoretically. The Shubnikov - de Haas (SdH) oscillations occur at the lower fields while the Quantum Hall (QH) oscillations occur at the higher fields. Both SdH and QH oscillations have the same periods: $\epsilon$F/?$\omega$c , where $\epsilon$F is the Fermi energy and the cyclotron frequency. Since the $\omega$c phases are different by $\pi$/2, transitions between the maxima and the minima occur at some magnetic field strength. A quantum statistical theory of the SdH oscillations is developed. A distinctive feature of two dimensional (2D) magnetic oscillations is the absence of the background. That is, the envelopes of the oscillations approach zero with zero-slope central line. The amplitude of the SdH oscillations decreases like [sinh(2$\pi$2M∗kBT/?eB)]−1 , where M∗ is the magnetotransport mass of the field-dressed electron distinct from the cyclotron mass m ∗ of the electron. A theory of the QHE is developed in terms of the composite (c)-bosons and c-fermions. The half integer QHE in graphene at filling factor $\nu$=(2P+ 1)/2, P = 0,±1,±2,{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered} arises from the Bose- Einstein condensation of the c-bosons formed by the phonon exchange between a pair of like-charge c-fermions with two fluxons. The QH states are bound and stabilized with a superconducting energy gap. They are more difficult to destroy than the SdH states. The temperature dependence of the magnetic resistance between 2 K and 50 K is interpreted, using the population change of phonons (scatterers).},
